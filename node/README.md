# Learning Node.js REST API Project

This is a basic Node.js project created for learning purposes. The project focuses on making REST API calls and implementing middleware for a simple web application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

Download with the exe on the [node website](https://nodejs.org/en)

or

Use [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to get a more specific version of node.


Check if node is installed in your terminal before proceeding:

```bash
node --version
```

### Running Project

```bash
clone or folk the repo...
cd node
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will run the server at localhost8000, nodemon is running in the background, so you can make changes to the node code and it will automatically update the server.

### Language Specifics
  
  - Since node is just Typescript, it runs in the exact same way as in the browser except on your local machine.
  - [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) was used since it is the standard for making REST APIs with node
  - For all things Typescript/Javascript related [Mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a good place to start.

#### Summary

Node is an incredibly simple backend solution that makes learning backend development easy for web developers. It is incredibly powerful to have one language for both the front end and the back end because it speeds up development and makes hiring for new positions easier. Although there are many cons to using node at a large scale, small to medium-small applications can seriously benefit from its practicality. That being said, if you plan on serving millions of users daily or have some more complicated actions, choosing a language such as go or rust might be a better option.
